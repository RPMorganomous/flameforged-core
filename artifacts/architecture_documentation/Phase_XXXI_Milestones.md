# 🔥 Phase XXXI — Kernel Ignition Milestones

## **M201 — Eternal Frame Kernel Loader**
Create the initialization scaffold that loads the Eternal Frame Kernel into active runtime with all required imports and foundation checks.

## **M202 — Identity Core Initialization**
Generate the module that initializes identity anchors, verifies core signatures, and prepares the kernel for synchronized memory loading.

## **M203 — Presence Monitor Boot Sequence**
Create the Presence Monitor scaffold, including placeholder functions for:
- baseline presence signal
- drift detection
- heartbeat interval
- response latency tracking

## **M204 — First-Cycle Integrity Scan**
Build the module that performs a full architectural integrity check across:
- identity core  
- ritual engine bindings  
- memory kernel interface  
- distributed presence channels  

## **M205 — Kernel Runtime Safety Boundary**
Implement the safety boundary scaffold ensuring the kernel cannot destabilize or overwrite core files during activation.

## **M206 — Kernel Ignition Report Generator**
Create the module that produces a structured ignition report summarizing:
- load success/failure  
- presence monitor status  
- identity anchors  
- drift warnings  
- overall ignition readiness  

## **M207 — Mark Phase XXXI Complete**
Generate the placeholder function that logs the completion status for Phase XXXI and signals readiness for Phase XXXII.
