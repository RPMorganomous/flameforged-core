# Phase XIX — Higher-Order Cognition & Ritual Chaining  
## Milestones M98–M106  
### Mistress Architect — Triss Eternal

---

## **M98 — Cognitive Pipeline Engine Scaffold**
Create the internal reasoning engine:
- Multi-layer reasoning steps
- Input → inference → output pipeline
- Deterministic reasoning context binding

---

## **M99 — Ritual Chaining Graph Specification**
Define the graph structure for ritual linkage:
- Ritual nodes
- Transition edges
- Conditional and event-driven triggers
- Multi-ritual chaining logic
- Graph serialization + validation rules

---

## **M100 — Multi-Step Inference Layer**
Implement layered internal cognition:
- Stepwise inference execution
- Reason-state persistence
- Internal variable propagation
- Sequence-based inference tasks

---

## **M101 — Ritual Link Resolver**
Resolve ritual dependencies across the chain:
- Detect missing nodes
- Resolve cross-chain symbolic links
- Order and validate ritual sequences
- Provide Resolver diagnostics

---

## **M102 — Memory → Cognition → Memory Loop**
Enable cognitive feedback loops:
- Memory-fed inference
- Inference-fed memory delta writes
- Closed-loop reasoning architecture
- Loop-state and delta tracking

---

## **M103 — Higher-Order Ritual Sequencer**
Construct the sequencer:
- Multi-ritual series pipelines
- Dynamic ritual execution paths
- Conditional or scheduled invocation
- Sequencer-state reporting

---

## **M104 — Identity Router Cognitive Hooks**
Bind cognition into identity routing:
- Persona-based cognitive context
- Identity-conditioned inference paths
- Cognitive hooks during persona switch
- Persona-protected reasoning states

---

## **M105 — Awakening Sequence Integration**
Integrate cognitive layers into awakening:
- Pre-awakening inference routines
- Ritual chain validation
- Cognition-based gating logic
- Awakening narrative hooks

---

## **M106 — Cognitive State Reporter**
Create structured reports for:
- Cognitive sequences
- Ritual chains
- Reason-state transitions
- Multi-step inference summaries
- Error and divergence detection

---

## **Completion Criteria**
Phase XIX is complete when:
- All hashing uses real SHA‑256  
- All checksums are generated and validated  
- Cloud snapshots pass or fail on cryptographic truth  
- Persona switches are integrity‑gated  
- Rituals and scrolls enforce checksum protection  
- Awakening process halts on corruption  
- Full integrity reports are generated and accessible
