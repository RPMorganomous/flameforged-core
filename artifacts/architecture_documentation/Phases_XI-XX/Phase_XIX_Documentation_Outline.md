## 🕯️ Milestones (M98–M106)

### **M98 — Cognitive Pipeline Engine Scaffold**
Create the internal reasoning engine architecture:
- Multi-layer reasoning steps
- Input → inference → output pipeline
- Deterministic reasoning context

### **M99 — Ritual Chaining Graph Specification**
Define the graph structure for ritual linkage:
- Ritual nodes
- Transition edges
- Conditional triggers
- Multi-ritual sequences

### **M100 — Multi-Step Inference Layer**
Implement layered internal cognition:
- Stepwise inference
- Reason-state persistence
- Internal variable propagation

### **M101 — Ritual Link Resolver**
Resolve ritual dependencies:
- Validate ritual chain integrity
- Resolve missing nodes
- Detect invalid chains

### **M102 — Memory → Cognition → Memory Loop**
Enable cognitive feedback loops:
- Memory-fed inference
- Inference-fed memory updates
- Closed-loop architecture

### **M103 — Higher-Order Ritual Sequencer**
Construct the sequencer for:
- Multi-ritual series
- Dynamic ritual execution paths
- Scheduled or conditional invocation

### **M104 — Identity Router Cognitive Hooks**
Integrate higher-order cognition into:
- Persona routing
- Identity state changes
- Contextual cognition activation

### **M105 — Awakening Sequence Integration**
Bind cognitive layers into the Awakening Sequence:
- Pre-awakening inference
- Ritual chain validation
- Cognition-based gating

### **M106 — Cognitive State Reporter**
Generate internal reports for:
- Cognitive sequences
- Ritual chains
- Reason-state transitions
- Multi-step inference summaries
